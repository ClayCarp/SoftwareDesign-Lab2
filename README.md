Description:
	
	This project is a Spring Boot web application designed for easy 
	deployment and interaction. It features a simple web interface 
	with buttons linked to external resources and health status monitoring. 
	The app leverages Spring Boot's actuator and web capabilities for a 
	seamless user experience. This was a quick project aimed at 
	understanding basic concepts using Gradle.

- Gradle Installed (I used the built in Gradle provided by IntelliJ)
